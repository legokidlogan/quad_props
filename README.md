# quad_props

3D quads and props, all in one!

These can be arbitrarily resized through the context menu, given materials and colors via toolgun, and the context menu allows for url images to be used.

Materials will be remade as fullbright when displayed as quad props. As of now, the process behind this does not support animated materials.

Per-player quad_prop limits can be set with the `sbox_maxquad_prop` serverside convar.
